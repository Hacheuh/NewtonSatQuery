# Newton Sat Query

This is my bachelor final project.
The main goal is to read an entry from the high energy detector onboard of the Spatial Telescopr XMM-Newton.
Thus, it scraps information on several existing database like LEDAS based on coordinates. This proves useful getting basic information on light sources.
